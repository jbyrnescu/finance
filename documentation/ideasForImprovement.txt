1. Have a program read the Excel file and update the configuration files automatically.
   (That would be cool!)

2. Discover and ask users about whether certain transactions that haven't been seen before are categorized properly.

3. Instead of just using Descriptions for Mandatory status, how about using a category?

4. Do a query that looks for Transactions without categories and alert user.

5. Create a column for normalized description.  This would search for a recognizable word or words in the description that does not include the numbers of the transaction or store number.
