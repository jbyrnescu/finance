3. Instead of just using Descriptions for Mandatory status, how about using a category?

4. Do a query that looks for Transactions without categories and alert user.

5. Create a column for normalized description.  This would search for a recognizable word or words in the description that does not include the numbers of the transaction or store number.

automatically categorize them.
