1. Have a program read the Excel file and update the configuration files automatically.
   (That would be cool!).  The first file that can be used/converted could be the
   DollarsPerDayExpenditures.  

2. Instead of just using Descriptions for Mandatory status, how about using a category?

3. Create a column for normalized description.  This would search for a recognizable word or words in the description that does not include the numbers of the transaction or store number.
(This is hard to do because some descriptions of transactions contain numbers.)

4. Create a program that queries Amazon's system/databases to figure out which
transactions were for what do something based on this information, like
automatically categorize them.  Or just list the description from Amazon so the user
can decide what to categorize them as.

5. Make DollarsPerDayExpenditures a monthly thing.  (just include monthly in there and
ignore it.  You can calculate one based on the other.  For example, if daily doesn't exist
use the monthly for the budget numbers.

6. Make DollarsPerDayExpenditures and maybe some other configuration files tables inside
the database including:
1) Budget.csv
2) MarkMandatoryMap.csv
3) Categorized.csv
4) (Maybe errors? - probably not though)
5) DollarsPerDayExpenditures.csv
6) allCategories.csv
7) SavingsPercentages.csv (although I don't remember how this one works at this point)
8) SuggestedSavings.csv (although I don't remember how this one works at this point - ditto from above)
9) pieChart.csv (spending percentages)
10) XcldFrmCshFlw.csv

7. Put the range in the budget so user knows what days are being accounted for (or whare
it started)

Completed ideas:

- Discover and ask users about whether certain transactions that haven't been seen before are categorized properly.
- Do a query that looks for Transactions without categories and alert user.

-- Both of these were implemented.  Essentially if a category inside the database (or read in
files from banks/cards) is not recognized from the categories list
(Categorize/Categorized.csv), the transaction is listed inside of the errors.csv
file.
-- Also, if there is no category at all, it is listed inside of the errors.csv file.
