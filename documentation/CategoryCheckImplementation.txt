The idea for this project is to compare the categorization list with a distinct list
of descriptions identifying transactions.

The categorization will effectively, (using programming), have wildcards at the end
and beginning (using regular expressions) and it will go through the
transaction list looking for a match.  If it doesn't find one, it will flag it
as possibly uncategorized.

Chase does categorization.  However, a lot of times, they are not done properly.

The user will be alerted to transactions with descriptions that aren't in the categorized
list.  In other words, a file with the transactions that are not recognized will be created.
