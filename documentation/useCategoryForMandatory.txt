This project would create the ability to mark as mandatory based on a category
not just a description.  For example, this would allow the user to mark all "gas"
category transactions as mandatory.

This would require that a new column be added to the MarkAsMandatory.csv
configuration file.  The column added would be to define the type of classification
it's for.

for example:
category,gas,M
description,CHEVRON,M
