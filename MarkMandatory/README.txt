Mark Mandatory is used to mark transactions that are never missed and
most likely due to a loan and property (secured) won't be missed based
on credit score.

I used it first to find what would happen in the future if things pan
out with the current situation.  I.E. Can i make this bill, will something bounce.

The "word formula" for that is:
How much will be spent (including mandatory (future), all (past) )
at point Z of your next CC payment.  (And can my Bank acct support that)

I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, all of this requires a Mandatory column.  So here I am.
