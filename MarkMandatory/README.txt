Mark Mandatory is used to mark transactions that are never missed and
most likely due to a loan and property (secured) won't be missed based
on credit score. Usually on Auto-pay.

I used it first to find what would happen in the future if things pan
out with the current situation.  I.E. Can i make this bill, will something bounce.

The "word formula" for that is:
How much will be spent (including mandatory (future), all (past) )
from point X (last CC payment?) to point Z (Next CC Payment).
(And can my Bank acct support that - what will my balance be
taking out known future payments)

We may be able to take the last bank account balance and just subtract
all future to get an answer.  (Take out all reconciled - at bank)

I hope that makes sense.

Anyway, all of this requires a Mandatory column.  So here I am.
